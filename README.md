# IDFG_TrailCam_UploadPhotos

Idaho Fish and Game (IDFG) deploys hundreds of trail cameras each year for wildlife population estimates and monitoring. These cameras capture 10+ million photos each sampling season. This R Shiny app uploads photos from Idaho Fish and Game trail cameras (after initial processing) to IDFG cloud account (password required).
